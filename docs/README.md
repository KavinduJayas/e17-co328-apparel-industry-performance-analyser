## Introduction

The second-largest source of income in Sri Lanka is the apparel industry. While lots of companies in this industry are gradually adopting new technologies like smart quality management systems, even some of the largest companies in Sri Lanka are still taking a very traditional approach in their product management. Even the slightest improvement in the efficiency and reliability of this process with seamless integration of new technologies like Big Data and ML could go a long way in strengthening the Sri Lankan economy. There is no better place than Hirdaramani Apparel, the third largest and the oldest apparel exporter in Sri Lanka, to take a big step in this direction. The possibility to make a contribution to such a shift is thrilling, especially with a project that has virtually no cost, yet promising results.
